Problem Description:
	An application which allows user to input his/her expense info - date, amount, and reason.
	The user can view his/her list of expenses.
Solution:
	Technologies:
		.Tomcat 8.5
		.JavaServlet
		.jQuery
		.MySql
		.HTML
	I created 3 HTML files: a welcome page, adding page, viewing page.
	I have 2 servlet files to for adding and sending results back to the front-end.
	
	The solution is more focus on the back-end.
	
Reasons behind the technical choices:
	The technologies I used for the tasks are quite old and long-term supported.
	I think many might know them and can easily make changes later in the future.

If I were to spend more time:
	I would have fixed a couple small bugs I have on the project.
	I might have use different technologies because they might be easier to implement and faster.
